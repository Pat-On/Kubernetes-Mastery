## Image Update for Cheeses
In the following lecture, you'll create some pods running a web server demo that displays images of cheese. This image was from the community but is no longer being updated, so I've created my version of them that now supports more architectures (arm64 and arm/v7) and an updated NGINX version.

So when you see errm/cheese, just replace with 

`bretfisher/cheese.`

The slides for these next few videos have also been updated with the new image names in commands.
