# Command Change In Next Lecture
In the next Lecture video, you'll see a command to describe the pod status,
 and the upstream NGINX project has changed its name slightly, from:

old: `kubectl describe -n ingress-nginx deploy/nginx-ingress-controller`

new: `kubectl describe -n ingress-nginx deploy/ingress-nginx-controller`

The ingress YAML and slides have been updated to reflect this change.
