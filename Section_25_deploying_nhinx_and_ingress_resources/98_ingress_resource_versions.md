## Ingress Resource Versions
Over the next ~10 lectures, you will hear me mention a few times about Ingress Resource types being beta, and that has now changed to v1. It was a minor update to Ingress and after reviewing all the videos, I didn't think they needed replacing.

## All YAML examples and slides have been updated to reflect the change from:

`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`
to

`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`
So just keep in mind where you hear me mention "beta" a few times, or show some YAML with v1beta1 in it, that the current version is just v1 and that the ingress slides and repo examples are all up to date!
